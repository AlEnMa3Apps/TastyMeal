# Recipe App - Cross-platform Application

## Overview

This project is part of my final project for a higher technical degree in Cross-platform Application Development. It is a recipe management app where users can create, edit, rate, and filter recipes. The app is built using **React Native** for mobile platforms, **Electron** for desktop, and **Spring Boot** for the backend, providing a seamless experience across multiple devices.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Create, Edit, and Delete Recipes**: Users can create, modify, and delete their recipes.
- **Recipe Rating**: Users can rate recipes to provide feedback to the community.
- **Recipe Filtering**: Users can filter recipes by ingredients, rating, or category.
- **Profile Management**: Edit and manage user profiles, including the ability to delete accounts.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on mobile (iOS & Android) and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React Native**: For building the mobile app.
  - **Electron**: For building the desktop app.
- **Backend**:
  - **Spring Boot**: RESTful API and business logic.
  - **MySQL**: Database management for recipe and user data.
- **Version Control**:
  - **Git & GitHub**: For collaborative development and version control.
  
## Development Process

We followed an Agile methodology with **Scrum**, using **Taiga** for task management and tracking. The project is developed iteratively, with regular sprints focusing on delivering functional features incrementally.
